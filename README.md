# Collection of Projects from LTIMindtree Training

Welcome to the repository of projects developed during my 3-month training at LTIMindtree! This repository contains a series of projects, each focusing on a specific topic and employing various technologies. These projects range from simple Java applications to more complex ones utilizing frameworks like Spring Boot, Angular, and microservices architecture.

## Overview

During my training, I worked on a variety of projects, each aimed at enhancing my skills and understanding of different technologies and concepts. The central theme across all projects is the development of an application for a college or university environment. The application allows students, teachers, and administrators to perform various tasks such as course enrollment, course management, and user authentication.

## Technologies

### 1. Basic Java

The first project is a fundamental Java application that lays the groundwork for subsequent projects. It includes basic functionalities such as user authentication, course enrollment, and course management.

### 2. Spring JDBC

Building upon the basic Java project, this project integrates Spring JDBC for database connectivity. It enhances the application with more robust database operations and structured data access.

### 3. Spring Boot

In this project, I utilized Spring Boot to simplify the setup and configuration of the application. Spring Boot's auto-configuration capabilities streamline development, allowing for faster implementation of features.

### 4. Eureka Microservices

Moving towards a microservices architecture, this project implements service discovery using Eureka. It breaks down the application into smaller, independently deployable services, improving scalability and resilience.

### 5. Spring RESTful API

This project focuses on building a RESTful API using Spring. It enables seamless communication between the client and server, following best practices for RESTful design and resource management.

### 6. Angular Client

The final project in the series incorporates an Angular-based client-side application. It provides a modern and responsive user interface for interacting with the backend services, offering an enhanced user experience.

## Functionality

Each project in the repository offers the same core functionality:

- User Authentication: Users can log in securely to access their accounts.
- Course Enrollment: Students can enroll in courses they wish to take.
- Course Management: Teachers and administrators can manage course assignments and curriculum.
- Introduction Viewing: Users can view introductions to specific courses to make informed decisions.
- User Registration: New users can sign up for accounts to access the application.

## Conclusion

These projects represent my journey of learning and mastering various technologies while working on practical, real-world scenarios. I hope they serve as both a learning resource and a testament to my skills and dedication to software development. Feel free to explore each project in detail and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
